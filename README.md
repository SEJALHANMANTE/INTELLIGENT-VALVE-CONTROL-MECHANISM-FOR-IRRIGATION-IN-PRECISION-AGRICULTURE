![BE PROJ POSTER (1)](https://github.com/SEJALHANMANTE/INTELLIGENT-VALVE-CONTROL-MECHANISM-FOR-IRRIGATION-IN-PRECISION-AGRICULTURE/assets/120907298/47c073a4-7b01-469e-94e3-5f822310247b)

This project introduces an **IoT and machine learning-based irrigation system** designed to optimize water management in agriculture. The **Intelligent Valve Control Mechanism** ensures precise irrigation by:  
- Monitoring real-time soil and environmental conditions.  
- Predicting water requirements using machine learning models.  
- Automating valve control to prevent under-watering and over-watering.  

### Key Features  
- **Data-Driven Predictions**: Uses soil moisture, humidity, and rainfall data.  
- **IoT Integration**: Real-time monitoring with sensors and a Raspberry Pi.  
- **Scalable & Efficient**: Reduces water wastage while maximizing crop yield.
