# INTELLIGENT-VALVE-CONTROL-MECHANISM-FOR-IRRIGATION-IN-PRECISION-AGRICULTURE
The project "Intelligent Valve Control Mechanism for Irrigation in Precision Agriculture" 
proposes an innovative approach to address the challenges of water management in agriculture using IoT
and machine learning techniques. The project aims to maximize crop yield by ensuring optimal irrigation levels
while minimizing water wastage. The hardware components of the system include moisture sensors, humidity sensors,
rain sensors for the intelligent valve. These sensors are deployed in the field to collect real-time data on soil 
moisture, weather conditions, and water flow. The data collected by these sensors is used as input for the machine 
learning model, which predicts the water requirements of the crops based on the current conditions. The machine 
learning model considers various factors such as soil moisture levels, humidity, and rainfall forecasts to determine 
the precise amount of water needed for irrigation. This information is then used to control the intelligent valve, 
which regulates the flow of water from the water tank to the fields. The valve opens and closes automatically based
on the predictions made by the machine learning model, ensuring that the crops receive the right amount of water at
the right time. One of the key advantages of the proposed system is its ability to prevent under-watering and over-watering of crops.
